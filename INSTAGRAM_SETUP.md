# Instagram API Setup Guide

To get real follower data from Instagram, you need to configure API access. Instagram has strict requirements for accessing follower lists.

## Option 1: Instagram Graph API (Recommended)

1. Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/)
2. Create a new app or use an existing one
3. Add Instagram Basic Display to your app
4. Configure the app and get your access token
5. Add these environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```
INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret_here
```

## Option 2: RapidAPI

1. Go to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
2. Subscribe to an Instagram scraper API
3. Get your API key
4. Add this environment variable to your `.env.local` file:

```
RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_here
```

## Current Status

The app is currently working and successfully fetching:
- ✅ Real profile information (follower counts, bio, etc.)
- ✅ Profile pictures and basic data
- ❌ Follower lists (requires authentication)

## Why Follower Lists Are Empty

Instagram requires authentication to access follower lists. This is a security measure to protect user privacy. Without proper API credentials, we can only access public profile information.

## What Works Now

- Profile information (name, bio, follower count, following count)
- Profile pictures
- Account statistics
- Public data analysis

## What Requires API Access

- List of followers
- List of following
- Who doesn't follow back
- Detailed follower analysis

## Testing

The app is currently working with real Instagram data. You can test it by entering any Instagram username and it will fetch the real profile information.

To get full follower analysis, you'll need to set up one of the API options above.
